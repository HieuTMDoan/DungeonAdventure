Model:
    Dungeon:
        -   Maze traversal algorithm
            -   Probably after doors, since doors change which rooms can be accessed

    Rooms:
        -   Placing doors on walls
        -   Randomizing damage tiles into rooms
        -   Loading player into adjacent room with stepping over a DoorTile
        -   Interacting with things as they are stepped on
            -   Items, Pits (Damage Tiles), Doors, etc.

    Player (honestly this could be its own class if we want):
        -   Inventory
        -   Using items
        -   Keeping track of explored rooms

    Other:
        -   Combat with monsters?
            -   Turn based? idk
