The Warrior’s skill is “Crushing Blow” which does 75 to 175 points of damage. The Priestess’s skill is “Heal” which heals 50 points of the player’s health. The Thief’s skill is “Surprise Attack”, with a 40 percent chance of it being successful. If it is successful, Thief gets an attack and another turn (extra attack) in the current round. There is a 20 percent chance the Thief is caught in which case no attack at all is rendered. The other 40 percent is just a normal attack. &#10;&#10;During the adventure, the player will encounter obstacles in the dungeon of monsters and pits. The player will engage in turn-based combat with a monster if they are adjacent to the monster from above, below, the left, or the right.  For every turn, the player has three options to choose from in combat: Attack (with chance), Use Skill, or Flee. To use a skill, the player must have at least 1 Skill Orb either given from the beginning or collected in the dungeon. The player can choose not to deal damage to the monster if they choose Flee. As for the monster, it takes a turn to either attack the player or heal themselves, both with chance, after the player's turn. Only when the monster is defeated, can the player continue exploring the dungeon. If the player is defeated, the game ends in a loss.&#10;&#10;The player will also be able to collect useful items that will support their journey, those being Health Potions (H), Vision Potions and Skill Orbs:&#10;•&#9;Health Potions (H): Heal the player's health.&#10;•&#9;Vision Potions (V): Enable visibility on all the surrounding rooms, displayed as rooms with painted walls on the map.&#10;•&#9; Skill Orbs (¤): Allow the player to use skill during combat.&#10;&#10;To move around in the dungeon, press keys ⬆️, ⬇️, ➡️, ⬅️, or keys W, A, S, D.&#10;To see the current discovered rooms and the player’s current location in the dungeon, press key M.&#10;To see the entire visible dungeon and the route to victory, press key Period (.).&#10;To pause the game, press key P or Esc.&#10;" wrapText="true" AnchorPane.bottomAnchor="111.0" AnchorPane.leftAnchor="100.0" AnchorPane.rightAnchor="100.0" AnchorPane.topAnchor="70.0">
